<div class="Bio">
    <p>
        Hi Iâ€™m Adam, the creator of PLA Prints. I have been using a Creality Ender 3 printer for the past 3 years and have lots of experience with different CAD programs. I have begun to realize the need for 3D printing in everyone's lives. There are just too many benefits of owning one! However, not everyone owns a 3D printer or has the skills to 3D print household objects. I am trying to create the availability of these resources through PLA Prints.
        <br>
        <br>
        Iâ€™m 14 years old, and I am always improving my skills. Iâ€™m excited to meet customers and help them fill their needs. Besides 3D printing, I am a human being with many other enjoyments. I love playing tennis, designing model rockets, swinging some golf clubs, and working on an FTC team.

        To the left, you can see my Creality Ender 3 Original printer. It has been modified with a few 3D printed upgrades, and runs quite well. I use Cura to export gcode files to the printer. Generally, I use the settings listed below.

        <h1>

        As stated in the title, I print PLA filament. There are many positive benefits of this filament that should be mentioned. It has the perfect melting point, is biodegradable, comes in a variety of colors, and it is easy to paint. More specifics about my PLA filament can be found below.
        </p>
