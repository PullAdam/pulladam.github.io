        Coin Conundrum is a game that can be enjoyed by anyone. The goal is to
        get more coins then anyone else. This is a conundrum though, because
        everyone has the same goal. Getting lucky cards helps you win, but
        winners often have good memory and strategy. When cards are put back in
        the deck piles they can be memorized. Players may also use strategy to
        chose when to end the game. They can select different cards to end the
        game sooner or later. Coin Conundrum also has an abstract creative
        theme. It has many things like treasure chests, coins, and wood. This is
        all created with color and detail. Coin conundrum may even make you
        think of going on a treasure hunt because of the wonderful art. But at
        the same time its design is abstract, bold, and bright. As you can see
        Coin Conundrum is a good coin-trading problem to have.
